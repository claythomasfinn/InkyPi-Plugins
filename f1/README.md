# Formula 1 Event Results Plugin  
This plugin pulls data from the [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) Python package, which provides extensive data on Formula 1 events, telemetry, results, and more.  
## Features  
 - Display Formula 1 event results including winners and teams
 - Show upcoming event
 - Integration to automatically update using InkyPi's interface
## Programming  
 - Frontend: HTML, Django
 - Backend: Python
 - Data: Pandas
## Installation  
This plugin can be easily cloned using the following command. Contributions and ideas are welcome!  
  
`git clone https://github.com/claythomasfinn/InkyPi-Plugins/tree/main/f1`  
  
InkyPi must already be downloaded and installed on compatible hardware (Raspberry Pi), and by downloading the plugins with the appropriate file path, they should automatically show on InkyPi's interface.  
## Issues  
This plugin requires a bit more processing power than some of the other native InkyPi plugins and thus works much better on a full-blown Raspberry Pi compared to a Zero W.
