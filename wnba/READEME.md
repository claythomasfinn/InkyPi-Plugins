# WNBA Scores Plugin  
This plugin pulls data from the [py_ball](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/py_ball) Python package, which provides extensive NBA and WNBA data.  
## Features  
 - Display WNBA scores and winners daily
 - Integration to automatically update using InkyPi's interface
## Programming  
 - Frontend: HTML, CSS, Django
 - Backend: Python
 - Data: Pandas
## Installation  
This plugin can be easily cloned using the following command. Contributions and ideas are welcome!  
  
`git clone https://github.com/claythomasfinn/InkyPi-Plugins/tree/main/wnba`  
  
InkyPi must already be downloaded and installed on compatible hardware (Raspberry Pi), and by downloading the plugins with the appropriate file path, they should automatically show on InkyPi's interface.  
## Issues  
This plugin requires a bit more processing power than some of the other native InkyPi plugins and thus works much better on a full-blown Raspberry Pi compared to a Zero W.
