# InkyPi Plugins  
These plugins were written directly for the [InkyPi](https://github.com/fatihak/InkyPi) open-source software designed for Raspberry Pi-powered E-Ink displays by [Fatih Ak](https://github.com/fatihak).  
## Features  
 - Data visualization from APIs
 - Integration to automatically update using InkyPi's interface
## Programming  
 - Frontend: HTML, CSS, Django
 - Backend: Python
 - Data: Pandas
## Installation  
The plugins can be easily cloned and installed using InkyPi's directions. InkyPi must already be downloaded and installed on compatible hardware (Raspberry Pi), and by downloading the plugins with the appropriate file path, they should automatically show on InkyPi's interface.  
## Issues  
These plugins require a bit more processing power than some of the other native InkyPi plugins and thus work much better on a full-blown Raspberry Pi compared to a Zero W.
